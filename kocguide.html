									<h1>This is my<br />
									Kingdoms Of Camelot Guide Project</h1>
									<p>
										The Kingdom of Camelot guide was a single lesson project back in primary school.<br>
										The task was simply "Create a web page related to a topic you enjoy."

									</p>

								<p>
									At this point in my life, I thought I was a top dog in computing- There were cases where I thought I knew more than the teacher, since the teacher told us methods that I thought were inefficient.
									Since I was confident, I went into making this webpage without any planning- Making a website couldn't be harder than making using functions in Excel right? </p>							
								<p>
									The website I decided to make was a guide for a game called "Kingdoms Of Camelot", which was owned by a company called 'Kabam' at the time. I don't know whether it was sold or if the companies merged or something like that, but it was later transferred to a company called 'RockYou'<br>
									At the time, the game was avaliable to play on Kabam's website and on Facebook, I played via Kabam. I thought I was a top player- I should easily be able to guide new players on how to progress.

								</p>
								<p>
									What you can see on the screenshot... is actually all there is to the site- I, at the time, thought "Well, it's a guide. People aren't looking for nice colours and pictures, they want information! <br>
									To start off with, I noticed that a bunch of guide sites centered the content, so I did the same. At the time I was very confident that the best way to do so was to use Bootstrap's grids. I understood that a column of 12 was max size, so I created 3 columns: col-3, col-6 and a second col-3. <br>
									I then put all the content in that middle col-6. 
								</p>
								<p>
									In this project, I put a bit too much blind faith into bootstrap, not putting any thought into how the site would look on various devices... fortunately, bootstrap pulled through and the site looked more or less the same on all devices.
