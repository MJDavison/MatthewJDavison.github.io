									<h1>This is my<br />
									Bug Tracker Project</h1>
									<p>The Bug Tracker Project is a simple ticketing system. I created it for two reasons: <br/> 
									First, to understand what I was lacking as a web developer, <br />
									Second, to use as a ticketing system for my own projects.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/bugtracker.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the 'My Tickets' page on the Bug Tracker" /></div>
								<p>When I began this project, I didn't want to just copy existing tools- While I could probably make a excellent tool that way, I'd learn nothing from it. Instead, I opened up Visual Studio Community 2019, made a new ASP.net Core templete and started designing the page. I didn't plan anything out, just created things as I went... As you can imagine, the source behind the project is a absolute mess at this point.</p>							
								<p>Due to this "careless" approach however, I learnt quite a bit... before this project, I knew nothing about "architectures", such as "Clean Architecture", I honestly, and naively, though that web development was purely designing the page and linking some buttons and text boxes up. My past self was a a bit stupid, evidently... Fortunately, while I'm still not 100% understanding of what "clean architecture" is all about, I now know some of what I'm lacking... I'll probably make another "careless" project in the future as well, but hopefully that project will be far more advanced than this one. </p>
								<p>Unfortunately, due to costs, I can't have the Bug Tracker live and accessable via the web at the current time.</p>
